Object Detection with MobileNet

This project demonstrates object detection using the MobileNet model. 
MobileNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture optimized for mobile devices. 
In this project, we leverage MobileNet for real-time object detection tasks.

Overview:
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video frame. 
The MobileNet model used in this project allows us to perform object detection efficiently, making it suitable for various applications, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality.

Features
Real-Time Detection: The MobileNet model is optimized for speed, enabling real-time object detection on resource-constrained devices.
Pre-Trained Model: We utilize a pre-trained MobileNet model trained on a large dataset, allowing us to detect a wide range of objects with high accuracy.
Easy Integration: The project provides straightforward integration with existing applications through simple APIs or deployment as a standalone service.
